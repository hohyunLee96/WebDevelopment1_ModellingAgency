(I have an issue with hosting website, the // keeps displaying in my html page and I tried to find why it keeps displaying // but I do not have // anywhere. these // occurs error with api so please keep that in mind. if you run my website with docker you can use api without any problem and you cannot see any //)

user credentials

admin - email: mark@gmail.com / password: mark
client - email: bill@gmail.com / password: bill

you can register with new user credential with pictures.

if the model is booked, and client is booking the model, you cannot delete them.


admin can delete,edit users, also delete, edit, creates models with javascript and api. admin can confirm booking or delete it requested by client with javascript and api. and the page will be automatically refreshed with api and javascript.

client can book the model with date, but if client chooses the past date then it`ll display an error, so client can only book models for future.
